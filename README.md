# Tour Agency Management System

## Introduction

The Tour Agency Management System is a Python-based command-line application designed to manage various aspects of a tour agency's operations. It leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and utilizes SQLAlchemy as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library to interact with a relational database.

The system provides functionality for managing tours, customers, bookings, and guides. Users can perform tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting tours, managing customer information, making bookings, and assigning guides to tours.

## Features

- **Tour Management:** Create, update, and delete tours with details like name, description, duration, and cost.

- **Customer Management:** Manage customer information, including name, contact details, and preferences.

- **Booking:** Allow customers to make bookings for specific tours.

- **Guide Assignment:** Assign guides to tours based on availability and expertise.

- **Data Persistence:** Data is stored in a relational database, making it persistent and easily retrievable.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Interact with the system through a user-friendly command-line interface.
